The following are instructions for compiling the program source code and associated AI modules:

Note that the release builds for each AI module are already located in the Players 
sub-directory of the MetaBlok folder so that the program may be played without compiling the 
source code. Simply launch the MetaBlok.exe executable program from the MetaBlok folder and the
program will detect any files within the Players directory.

The simulator was developed using Windows Visual Studio 2008 and the DirectX9 SDK, both of 
these products could be acquired from the web pages below at the time of this writing. Visual
Studio 2010 may work as well, however all of the programs included with this project have
been tested exclusively using Visual Studio 2008. (The free Express Edition)

If you have not already, the DirectX sdk must be setup for use with Visual Studio prior to
compiling the main program code. If you have run Visual Studio prior to installing the
DirectX SDK, the relevant files may already have been added. If not, you will likely receive
the error "Cannot open include file: 'd3d9.h': No such file or directory". All other project
files can be compiled without linking to the DirectX SDK.

As stated above, after installation Visual Studio must be told where the DirectX SDK files
reside if it was not done automatically. Instructions for doing so are as follows:

      (1) Open the "Tools" menu and select "Options..."
      (2) Select "Projects and Solutions" -> "VC++ Directories"
      (3) TODO

All project files compile to the MetaBlok directory by default. AI Player projects will compile
to the subdirectory MetaBlok/Players while the main program compiles to MetaBlok/. ( If you are
unfamiliar with VS, the hotkey for build is F7. )
