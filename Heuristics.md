# Minimax #

The Minimax AI player currently features a single heuristic. This heuristic is a combined weighting of the current score for each player and the sum total of the number of free grid squares within 4 tiles of each liberty. This heuristic currently ranks best in the testing performed both against the Beam heuristic and other Blokus AIs.
