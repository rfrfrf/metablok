	Project: Blokus AI - Beam 

	Description:
	 An AI player similar to Minimax with more extensive pruning techniques.
	 Rather than simple Alpha-Beta pruning, liberties which fall outside a
	 standard FIGHTING_DISTANCE from liberties of the other player are 
	 ignored. See the documentation for more implementation details.
